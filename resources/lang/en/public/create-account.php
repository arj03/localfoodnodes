            Using the site is free, but in order to send orders of food, you need to become a supporting member.
            The membership fee is individual and the size of it is self-determined by you! You get to decide how this fits in your economic situation and what value you feel that this is providing you and all of our local communities. Because, whatever amount you set, you are co-funding and co-creating a healthier and more local food supply. Read more here about supporting memberships (coming soon), or sign up and get started.
