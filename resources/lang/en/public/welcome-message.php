    'welcome_paragraph1' => 'Welcome to Local Food Nodes, it’s great to see you here. We’ve been looking forward to it :)',

    'welcome_paragraph2' => 'The platform is meant to function as infrastructure for local food distribution, at this stage we are trying to handle ordering and logistics information. On this site you can pre-book produce that you will later pick up at listed pick up/delivery locations called nodes.',

    'welcome_paragraph3' => 'This platform wants to enable direct relationships between you as a customer and the producers. Payments will be made directly to each producer that you order food from in a manner that is accepted by the specific producer.',

    'welcome_paragraph4' => 'In order to place an order on the system you have to submit a yearly membership fee, that fee however, is not a fixed amount but instead what you feel that this service is worth and what fits in your economic situation. It can be as small as the simply the creditcard transaction cost or as large as you wish.',

    'welcome_paragraph5' => 'As a consumer you will be able to track your orders and when you need to pick them up. In the not-to-distant future we intend to also give you the ability to mark your orders as “paid” as well as giving the producer the ability to mark orders with “payment recived”.',

    'welcome_paragraph6' => 'If you are a producer you are invited to create a producer account (following the link in the site menu), list your information and your products so that they can be ordered to the nodes that you wish to deliver to when you feel such deliveries will be appropriate.',

    'welcome_paragraph7' => 'The administration of all three different roles (customer, node admin, or producer) can be accessed through the different parts of the sitemenu.',

    'welcome_paragraph8' => 'If you do not have a delivery node close to you or for other reasons feel the need for additional pick-up/delivery nodes close to you, you can start a node by simply following the create node link (in the site menu).',

    'welcome_paragraph9' => '<b>This is a beta-release.</b> That means this is public-testing of the product. We hope you wont encounter too many bugs och inconsistencies on the site but we need your help testing it to get it off the ground. And besides, we don’t want to wait to give this to the local food communities so we are happy to offer the tool to us all right now!',

    'welcome_paragraph10' => 'You can contact us directly for more support by clicking the chatbubble in the bottom right corner and writing in the chat window.',

    'welcome_paragraph11' => 'We are thrilled to help administer a future of local food production and hope that you will enjoy using the platform. Again, many welcomes! ',
